The python notebook contains code for pre-processing audio data and training two network architectures implemented using Pytroch. The M5 architecture is a CNN based on the architecture proposed in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00087.pdf) paper whereas ResNet15 is a simplified version of the deep residual network proposed in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10361.pdf) paper.

Dataset used can be downloaded using torchaudio.
